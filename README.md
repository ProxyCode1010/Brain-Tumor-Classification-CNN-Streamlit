# Brain-Tumor-Classification-CNN-Streamlit
Brain tumor detection system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and trained on MRI image datasets. The project includes a web-based Streamlit application that predicts tumor types — glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor — from uploaded brain scan images.
